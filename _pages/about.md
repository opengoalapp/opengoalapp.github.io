I'm Charles William, and I've been involved in football data and analytics in both and amateur and professional capacity since 2012.

Currently I'm Head of Data at [360 Scouting](https://360-scouting.com/), a Netherlands based company specialising in supporting professional clubs with their global scouting requirements.

This blog hosts my personal, publicly available work. Feel free to get in touch if you have any questions about anything you see on the site, it would be great to hear from you.

Contact opengoalcharles@gmail.com for any enquiries.
